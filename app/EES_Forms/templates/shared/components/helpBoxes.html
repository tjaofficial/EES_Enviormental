            Packets are an easy way to put forms into 
            organized groups. These packets can be 
            used to print off groups of "submitted"
            inspection forms. To add a new packet, 
            enter in a new "Packet Name" and click "save". 
            Once saved, you will see a blue bar appear
            with the new packet name. You can drag-and-drop forms from the top into the packets or you can click "add" to
            to advance to the add page. You can click the blue bar to expand the packet
            and see the existing forms within. To the right of the packet you will see
            the settings or delete icons.
